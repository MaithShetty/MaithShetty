# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Maithili Shetty.

As a passionate iOS developer and Team Lead, I thrive on transforming ideas into seamless, user-centric mobile applications for Fortune 500 companies.
My journey in the tech landscape spans various industries, from shaping retail experiences to optimizing manufacturing processes and enhancing transportation solutions.

ðŸš€ Currently, I lead a dynamic team dedicated to crafting innovative iOS apps that leave a mark on diverse domains. 
Beyond my role, I'm a proud volunteer evangelist at Women Who Code, advocating for diversity and inclusion in the tech community.

ðŸŒŸ What sets me apart? I believe in the power of simplicity.
My coding philosophy revolves around breaking down complex problems into manageable chunks, finding joy in every small solution that contributes to a bigger impact. 
I am continually curious, always seeking ways to solve everyday challenges through the lens of technology.

ðŸ“š Outside of coding, you'll find me immersed in books, fueled by a thirst for knowledge, or exploring new destinations. 
I'm fascinated by the potential of technology to simplify our lives, and I'm on a mission to contribute my part to that narrative.

Let's connect and collaborate on projects that matter! ðŸŒˆâœ¨
